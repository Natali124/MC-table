  <p class="info" id="G1D"><b>Galois theory crash course </b>(Mark,<grey>M</grey>TWΘF)<br><br>
    In 1832, the twenty-year-old mathematician and radical (in the political sense) Galois died tragically,
    as the result of a wound he sustained in a duel. The night before Galois was shot, he hurriedly scribbled
    a letter to a friend, sketching out mathematical ideas that he correctly suspected he might not live to
    work out more carefully. Among Galois’ ideas (accounts differ as to just which of them were actually in
    that famous letter) are those that led to what is now called Galois theory, a deep connection between
    field extensions on the one hand and groups of automorphisms on the other (even though what we
    now consider the general definitions of “group” and “field” were not given until fifty years or so later).
    If this class happens, I expect to be rather hurriedly (but not tragically) scribbling as we try to cover
    as much of this material as reasonably possible. If all goes well, we might conceivably be able to get
    through an outline of the proof that it is impossible to solve general polynomial equations by radicals
    once the degree of the polynomial is greater than 4. (This depends on the simplicity of the alternating
    group, which we won’t have time to show in this class.) Even if we don’t get that far, the so-called
    Galois correspondence (which we should be able to get to, and probably prove) is well worth seeing!

        are surprisingly useful objects in set theory and combinatorics.

          Many many aspects of the algebra of finite fields boil down to understanding a single map: the
          Frobenius homomorphism x → x<sup>p</sup>! In this class we’ll pick up where Viv’s week 3 class left off and
          dive into the algebraic side of finite fields. We’ll see how the Frobenius homomorphism and its powers
          are a tool for distinguishing between different finite fields, we’ll see how they fit together, and we’ll
          understand (in the 2 day version) what the algebraic closure of F<sub>p</sub> is and the structure of its subfields.

                What makes some combinations of notes more pleasant to listen to than others? Why does the

                arbitrary facts that just coincidentally combine in ways that happen to sound nice.
                But it turns out that many of these complicated musical constructions can be derived as corollaries
                from just a couple of basic conditions that we might want our music to satisfy! You will reach these
                conclusions for yourselves by working through a set of problems in groups. The rich, complex intricacy?

                    computers to factor numbers in O(b<sup>3</sup>) time, where b is the number of bits of the number being
                    factored. In comparison, not even the state-of-the-art algorithms on classical computers are able
                    to factor arbitrary numbers in polynomial time. Because of this, and given that the most common
                    cryptographic algorithm (RSA) depends on the intractability of factoring large pseudo-primes by brute
                    force, there is a large interest in quantum computers from a security standpoint.
                    Shor’s paper is very interesting in its own right, and its study can be split into two. First, we study
                    the “classical” part of the algorithm, which shows how we could factor numbers quickly if we were able
                    to find the order of numbers with respect to the right modulus. The quantum part of the algorithm
                    is precisely how to find these orders, and introduces the very interesting quantum Fourier transform.

                      Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to
                      become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. One
                      subfield of ML is known as supervised learning, in which we use historical data (e.g. past measurements)
                      as inputs in order to obtain these predictions.
                      In order for ML to pull off the futuristic cool stuff one day (such as self-driving cars), we’ll need to
                      start small. An example: I have a polynomial curve of unknown degree (but let’s say the degree is less than 10), and I give you the coordinates of 10 points on the curve. We want to find a polynomial
                      formula that accurately describes these points and any future points on my curve that I give you. How
                      do we go about this?
                      The tricky part about it is that solving the problem exactly (via the so-called Lagrange interpolation
                      formula) won’t necessarily give you a better solution. In fact, it is likely to give you something terrible
                      that won’t be even close to how the actual curve looks like, due to a phenomenon called overfitting.
                      In order to solve the problem correctly, the class will go over the essentials of supervised learning:
                      doing a linear regression in order to find suitable formulas and using regularization to avoid overfitting.
                      What do all these buzzwords mean? Come to class and find out!

                        Commutative algebraists have their excellent rings and algebraic geometers have their wonderful com-
                        pactifications, but no one achieves perfection like graph theorists. In this class, we will prove none other
                         
                        than the Perfect Graph Theorem which, in addition to having an excellent1 name, has an exceedingly
                        clever proof.
                        So, what is perfection? In Graph Colorings, we proved that ω(G) ≤ χ(G) and then asked, can we
                        push those two invariants arbitrarily far apart. An alternative question one might ask is, what graphs
                        achieve equality? Or even better, which graphs achieve equality and have that their subgraphs achieve
                        equality too? The answer, perfect graphs! And what’s more, the Perfect Graph Theorem gives us an
                        elegant characterization of these graphs.
                        Note: Graph Colorings is not a prerequisite.

                          A group can be thought of as a collection of reversible operations, with some rules about how they
                          relate to each other. Such a way of thinking is called a group presentation, and as an example, we have
                          that the cyclic group of order 3 can be written as hx|x
                           
                          3 = ei, where x is a generator, and x
                          3 = e is a
                          relation. Given a group presentation with a finite set of generators and relations, does there always
                          exist an algorithm to tell if a word in the generators is the identity? This is called the Word Problem,
                          and it was posed by Max Dehn in 1911. The surprising answer, shown by Pyotr Novikov in 1955, is
                          no - there does not exist such an algorithm. In this class, we will prove this result by studying how
                          we can embed “uncodable” sets in groups. This will give us a candidate for a “bad” group for which
                          a solution to the word problem would contradict the “uncodablity” of the set. <br>

                            Two elements x, y of a group G are said to be conjugate if there exists a g ∈ G such that gxg<sup>-1</sup> = y.
                            If we consider the set of all elements that are conjugate to x in G, this is called the conjugacy class
                            of x. Now if we let G be the symmetric group S, the conjugacy classes partition S is a rather nice
                            way - by cycle type of the permutations. In this class, we will prove this beautiful fact, as well as find
                            a formula for the size of each conjugacy class.
                            But we won’t stop there! What happens if we restrict the g’s used above to be elements of a
                            subgroup of G, say A? Will the conjugacy classes in A<sub>n</sub> also be completely determined by cycle

                              Did you know that there are infinitely many primes?
                              This fact has been proven many times in many different ways, but in this class we’re actually going
                              to ask a different question.
                              Did you know that there are infinitely many primes congruent to a (mod q), as long as a and q are
                              relatively prime?
                              Dirichlet showed this in the 1900s using some of my favorite ideas in all of mathematics. The ideas
                              that he used include group theory, complex analysis, and his class number formula (see week 2). The
                              ideas that we will use. . . are a subset of those, but a pretty big subset.

                                    A few years ago, I came across a YouTube video about a game called Dr. Nim (https://youtu.be/
                                    9KABcmczPdg). It’s a little computer that can play a simple game against a human with perfect
                                    strategy. It’s a fairly simple game — one-pile nim — but the amazing part is that there are no
                                    electronics. Just using mechanical pieces and gravity, the “computer” chooses how many marbles to
                                    drop, and drops them all on its own. It’s not the first example of a mechanical computer — people
                                    started dreaming up computers long before modern electronics. But is Dr. Nim really a computer at
                                    all? It can really only do one thing.
                                    A new game came out in 2018 called Turing Tumble (https://www.turingtumble.com/). It’s a
                                    marble contraption similar to Dr. Nim, but has components that can be plugged in and arranged on
                                    a big peg board. It can do a lot of things; for example, it can do addition and multiplication, and it

                                      tiny triangles, and paint all the corners of all of those with the three colors, so that each color on the

                                      or blue, and each color on the edge between red and green is red or green.
                                      Sperner’s Lemma says there is at least one tiny triangle with a corner of each color.

                                        The Green–Tao Theorem is a celebrated result in mathematics: the primes contain arbitrarily large
                                        arithmetic progressions. That is, for any k ∈ N, the set of primes contains some sequence of points in
                                        the form a, a + d, a + 2d, . . . , a + kd.
                                        In this class we’ll look at something much easier to prove, that the primes get arbitrarily close
                                        to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Proving this should help shed some light on why the
                                        Green–Tao Theorem is true – and we’ll see that it has a lot to do with the “size” of the set of prime
                                        numbers.
                                        Consequently, we’ll spend some time looking at a variety of ways to define the “size” of a subset of
                                        the natural numbers, and consider whether or not sets that are large or small in these notions of size
                                        should or could contain arbitrarily large arithmetic progressions.

                                          In my Week 2 class “The Pirate Game,” I spent several minutes bad-mouthing the Prisoners’ Dilemma,
                                          saying that I just found it utterly boring and completely, profoundly devoid of anything resembling
                                          interest.
                                          That might have been a bit harsh, and I’m here now to also admit that it was a bit unfair. I do
                                          know of one theorem that makes the Prisoners’ Dilemma a little more interesting—well, a LOT more
                                          interesting, truth be told. This is one of the so-called “Folk Theorems” of game theory.
                                          Usually, when we analyze sequential games, we start at the “end” of the game and work backwards.
                                          But what if we don’t know when the game is going to end? In practical “games” that occur in “real
                                          life,” this is often the case because most of us cannot predict the future.
                                           
                                          It turns out that analyzing
                                           
                                          such games is much more difficult, and therefore much more interesting.
                                          In this class, we’ll talk more about credible threats, about how to even start thinking about “infinite
                                          games” (i.e. games where there’s no fixed end point), and a kind of strategy called a “grim trigger.”
                                          Time permitting, we’ll also talk about why all the game theorists HATE Ben’s Favorite Game Theory
                                          Result. If even more time permits, we might even talk about mercy, forgiveness, and grace, but I
                                          really can’t make any promises on that front.

                                              perhaps you know that 2<sup>22</sup> = 4194304. However, if I asked you to find me a power of two starting
                                              with ‘616263646566’, that’s a whole other story. Rather remarkably though, such a power exists. In
                                              fact, for any sequence of digits S (which is not a power of 10), there exists a power of two that starts
                                              with those digits! The delightful proof comes from Ingenuity in Mathematics and will be the starting

                                                the natural numbers. In fact, the power set of any set A is larger than A. In fact in fact, the power set
                                                of N turns out to be precisely the size of R. This begs the question: are there sizes of infinity between
                                                |N| and |R|?
                                                In this class, we will not answer that question. We will blow right past that question, assume that
                                                we’re in a universe with intermediate sizes of infinity, and ask ourselves: how do those intermediate
                                                sizes of infinity behave? Using an extra-set-theoretic axiom called Martin’s Axiom, we can show that
                                                intermediate sizes of infinity behave in several crucial ways like the natural numbers.
                                                If you’ve ever looked at an induction proof and thought, “Man, this is cool and all, but I really wish
                                                it involved more posets,” this could be the class for you!

                                                  In the philosophy of math, realism is commonly explained to be a position according to which math-

                                                  definition is itself far from cut and dry). How exactly can we interpret what it means for a mathemat-

                                                        in it. Since then, no such question has showed up again. In this class, we go back to the halcyon days
