    What happens if we come up with math models to describe the phenomena of human sleep and
    circadian rhythms? What if we hook these models up to people’s wearables and run them on phones?
    What if we use the models to compute what people should do during the day to sleep better at night?

  <p class="info" id="G1hD"><b>Better sheep through modeling</b> (J-Lo, <grey>MTW</grey> ΘF)<br><br>
    Sheep need food, but there is not always enough food to go around. How do individuals (like sheep)
    respond to a lack of resources? Will they become aggressive and greedy, or learn to cooperate? If they
    settle on a solution, will they keep their word or betray each other’s trust?
    Evolutionary game theory is the study of how strategies and behaviors change over time. By
    making some simple assumptions about how individual sheep make decisions, we will be able to make
    predictions about how the entire herd changes. 
    <br><br><i>Class format:</i> The class will start with a game: you will be a sheep trying to collect as much food
    as possible. This will be followed by some whole-group review and discussion of this game, where
    participants will have the opportunity to share their thoughts if they wish to. The class will gradually
    transition to more of a lecture formatas we begin to define some tools that can be used to study
    games of this kind. <br>

  <p class="info" id="G2D"><b>A pair of fractal curves</b>(Ben, MTW<grey>ΘF</grey>)<br><br>
    “Fractal” is one of those words that comes up a lot in popular math; usually the definition is something
like “a shape that looks like a part of that same shape.” In this class, we’ll start by investigating a
pair of fractal curves and then try to peer, just a little bit, into a more general picture. <br>

The two particular curves, the Cantor–Lebesgue Staircase and Minkowski’s ? Function, both arise
when we switch between different ways of writing real numbers—in base two or base three, or as
continued fractions. The more general picture should provide some insight into what would happen
if we chose other perspective still. Best of all, the Cantor-Lebesgue Staircase is a very useful function
to see at least once, because it is a particularly fun counterexample!

  <p class="info" id="G2hD"><b>The pirate game</b>(Ben, <grey>MTW</grey> ΘF) <br><br>
    In modern political science and economics, one of the major mathematical tools for analyzing and
solving problems is game theory. Real, serious people use game theory to study real, serious problems. <br>
That’s not really what this course is about. We’ll first cover some of the first basics of game theory,
to make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes time to think about some very unserious,
entertaining, fun games. These games include such deep and relevant questions as: What should you
do when you’re captured by the bears? How many pirates have to die while dividing up treasure?
How can the JCs best resolve their differences through the noble art of Nerf gun warfare? <br>
Nevertheless, if you’ve heard a bit about game theory and want to get a grasp on the basics, this
class should help familiarize you with some of the terminology and give you a good starting point for
later investigations.

    <p class="info" id="G3D"><b>Curvature lies within</b> (Apurva Nakade, MTWΘF)<br><br>
      Thanks to several high-res photos of outer space, we have experimentally verified one of the most
  
  counter-intuitive predictions of Einstein’s theory of general relativity: that mass bends the space-
  time continuum. Gravity arises as the bending of this space-time continuum and is mathematically
  
  indistinguishable from curvature. But what does it mean for space-time to bend? How can we tell
  that our universe is curved without being able to look at it from the outside?<br/> 
  In this 2-chili class, we’ll answer some of these questions for two-dimensional objects. We’ll define
  curvature à la Gauss and use it to study the geometry of surfaces. We’ll do some explicit computations
  and, time permitting, prove the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.
  <br><br>
      <i>Class format:</i> The class will be a mix of lectures and IBL. You should expect to spend a considerable

  <p class="info" id="G5D"><b>Insert geometry joke here</b> (Zoe, MTWΘF)<br><br>
    Looking at drawings, Pac-man’s universe, or even the ground we walk on, many things appear “flat”.
    Looking at space locally only tells us so much about the fundamental properties of the space itself.
    In this class we will look at an overview of different geometries and the ways of thinking of surfaces.
    We will especially look at ways of visualizing spaces and how they connect to problems one might
    encounter in various areas of math. <br>
    
    It can be extremely valuable to consider problems in spaces where they naturally reside. Mathematically, if we have a problem that loops in on itself, say considering words with two letters, we
    might want to consider solving that problem on a torus. If we need to differentiate the parity of an
    object, maybe it lives in a Möbius strip? For example, if we are looking to accurately represent what
    we see around us in a drawing on a piece of paper, we are using the properties of projective space! <br>
    <br><i>Class format:</i> The class will mostly be lectures with interruptions of hands on activities that campers
    will be recommended to participate in <br>
    <i>Prerequisites:</i> Linear algebra, if you’re taking the week 1 Introduction to linear algebra at the same

  <p class="info" id="G6D"><b>Euclidean geometry beyond Euclid</b> (Yuval Wigderson,  MTW<grey>ΘF</grey>)<br><br>
    The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a sonnet

    called “Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare”.
    In many ways, I agree with the sentiment—Euclidean geometry is one of the most beautiful subjects
    in mathematics, full of astonishing results and miraculous proofs. But I don’t think it’s fair to say
    that Euclid has a monopoly on its beauty; there’s a ton of beauty in Euclidean geometry that Euclid
    didn’t know about! <br>
    This class will be about those things: questions that Euclid might have asked (but didn’t), and
    
    theorems that Euclid might have proved (but didn’t). In many cases, we’ll see that some simple-
    looking problems in Euclidean geometry lie on the forefront of modern mathematics, more than 2000
    
    years after Euclid almost posed them (but didn’t). For instance, it turns out that to really understand
    a basic question about counting points and lines in the plane, you probably need to understand ℓ-adic
    étale intersection cohomology and perverse sheaves.
    Unfortunately, I have no idea what ℓ-adic étale intersection cohomology and perverse sheaves are, so
    we won’t really get into that. But I plan to discuss a number of different topics in not-quite-Euclidean
    geometry, show you some of the surprising connections to other areas of mathematics like number
    theory and probability, and tell you about several conjectures that are still unproven, even though
    they could be as old as Euclid (but aren’t).

The integers modulo p form a field (that is to say, a set where we can add, multiply, subtract, and

  <p class="info" id="G10D"><b>Functions of a complex variable (1 of 2)</b> (Mark, MTWΘF )<br><br>
    Spectacular (and unexpected) things happen in calculus when you allow the variable (now to be called
    z = x + iy instead of x) to take on complex values. For example, functions that are “differentiable” in
    a region of the complex plane now automatically have power series expansions. If you know what the
    values of such a function are everywhere along a closed curve, then you can deduce its value anywhere
    inside the curve! Not only is this quite beautiful math, it also has important applications, both inside
    and outside math. For example, functions of a complex variable were used by Dirichlet to prove his
    famous theorem about primes in arithmetic progressions, which states that if a and b are positive
    integers with gcd(a, b) = 1, then the sequence a, a + b, a + 2b, a + 3b, . . . contains infinitely many
    primes. This was probably the first major result in analytic number theory, the branch of number
    theory that uses complex analysis as a fundamental tool and that includes such key questions as the
    Riemann Hypothesis. Meanwhile, in an entirely different direction, complex variables can also be used
    to solve applied problems involving heat conduction, electrostatic potential, and fluid flow. Dirichlet’s
    theorem is certainly beyond the scope of this class and heat conduction probably is too, but we’ll prove
    a major theorem due to Liouville that 1) leads to a proof of the so-called “Fundamental Theorem of
    Algebra”, which states that any nonconstant polynomial (with real or even complex coefficients) has
    a root in the complex numbers; I believe Jorge will give the details in a week 4 class and 2) is vital
    for the study of “elliptic functions”, which have two independent complex periods, and which may be
    the topic of a week 5 class. Meanwhile, we should also see how to compute some impossible-looking
    improper integrals by leaving the real axis that we’re supposed to integrate over and venturing boldly
    forth into the complex plane! This class runs for two weeks, but it should be worth it. (If you can
    take only the first week, you’ll still get to see a good bit of interesting material, including one or two
    of the things mentioned above.)

    <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, it is frowned upon for me to plagiarize Viv’s class, so we will learn something else!
Following Hatcher’s Topology of Numbers, we are going to draw some pretty pictures and use them
to derive some interesting facts about quadratic forms (including classifying quadratic forms by their
discriminants, proving that the class number is finite, and figuring out which integers can be output
by a quadratic form).

  </mfrac>
</math>
 The point of the denominator is to try to balance the sizes of S and S<sup>c</sup>. You can think of sparsest cut
as a discrete analogue of the isoperimetric problem. <br>
Is there an efficient way to find the minimum? The short answer is “probably not,” but fortunately,
there is an efficient way to approximate the solution: if G has N vertices, then there is an algorithm
that gives you a subset S which does not necessarily attain the minimum, but it will not be too far
off. In particular, it will be within a factor of log N of the minimum. <br>
In this class, we will introduce the algorithm and then discuss why this algorithm produces good
approximations. A key part of the proof is connecting the sparsest cut problem to a fundamental
question about discrete geometric spaces. If there is time, we will briefly mention how the discrete
5-dimensional Heisenberg group plays a role in a better (but more difficult) approximation algorithm
for sparsest cut. These are just some of the many examples of the connections between theoretical
computer science and metric geometry. <br>

    <b>The calculus of variations</b> (Ben, MTWΘF)<br><br>
    In the ordinary calculus, one asks questions about functions—things like “where does this function have a maximum?” where the answer is going to be some number in the function’s domain. In the calculus of variations, we study how to use the ideas of the calculus for questions like “which curve connecting these points has the smallest arc length?” where the answer is not some number, but some <i>function</i>.<br>

We’ll see a little bit of how these ideas relate to physics, and we’ll prove and discuss one of the most important results for the study of modern physics. Noether’s Theorem says that the symmetries of the laws of physics correspond to conserved quantities. Before Noether, it was well-understood that some quantity that we call “energy” doesn’t change over time, and most people implicitly assumed that the laws of physics were the same today as they were yesterday—they’re symmetric over time, that is. Noether’s Theorem, among other things, states that the latter fact <i>implies</i> the former—the fact that the laws of physics remain the same over time tells us that energy is conserved.

    Einstein’s general theory of relativity says that matter tells spacetime how to curve and the curvature of spacetime tells matter how to move. Suppose our spacetime contains a single spherical, static mass such as the sun. The Schwarzschild solution of Einstein’s equations describes the geometry of spacetime in the empty space surrounding the mass. If the mass is sufficiently concentrated, we have a black hole—a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape. In this course, we won’t derive or solve the Einstein equations. Instead, we’ll first spend a few days building up some needed formalism (coordinate transformations, tensors, metrics, and geodesics). Then we’ll posit the form of Schwarzschild solution and see how its geometry leads to the bizarre physics of black holes. Finally, we’ll discuss in grisly detail what will happen to an astronaut unlucky enough to fall into a black hole (spoiler alert: it’s called “spaghettification”).

    One very simple way to show that two shapes have the same size is to cut one into a few pieces and
then rearrange those pieces to form a copy of the other (just straight-line cuts and only finitely many
pieces—no shenanigans allowed, we’re not doing set theory!). We can show that this always works for
polygons: given polygons P and Q with the same area, we can always cut P into finitely many pieces
using straight-line cuts and then reassemble those pieces into a copy of Q. <br>
This raises a natural question: what about polyhedra? In 1900, Hilbert listed the question of
whether two polyhedra of equal volume can always be “decomposed into each other” as one of 23
problems he thought would guide mathematical research in the coming century. (Granted, this one
turned out to be a bit easier than expected—it was solved a year later by Hilbert’s own student,
Dehn.) The solution to the problem is a beautiful application of abstract algebra ...and a little pinch
of the axiom of choice (OK fine we may be doing a teeny bit of set theory).

  <p class="info" id="2G5D"><b>Incidence combinatorics</b> (Aaron, MTWΘF)<br><br>
    “My most striking contribution to geometry is, no doubt, my problem on the number
    of distinct distances.” — Paul Erdős <br>
    <br> In 1946, Paul Erdős asked two simple questions: If you place n points in the plane, and then measure
    the distances between every pair of points, what is the minimum number of distinct distances you can
    get? What is the maximum number of pairs of points that can be exactly distance 1 from each other?<br>
    <br>The Distinct Distances Problem served as a challenge for decades, with mathematicians inventing
    a whole new field of mathematics – incidence combinatorics – to create a better lower bound every
    few years. Finally in 2015, Guth and Katz won a bunch of prizes for almost solving it. Meanwhile,
    the Unit Distances Problem is wide open—only one improvement has been made since 1946.<br>
    <br>We will work together to reinvent this philosophy of counting, prove basically the best-known bounds
    on the Unit Distances Problem, and learn how you can count all kinds of things with just points on
    lines and curves.<br>
    <br> <i>Class format:</i> IBL: This class will consist almost entirely of solving problems. Other than a brief intro
    each day, and some opportunities to present work, we will be in breakout rooms, working on the same
    problems. <br>
    <i>Prerequisites:</i> We will briefly use some probability theory (it will be good if you understand the phrase
“linearity of expectation”). I’ll also assume some graph theory, though I’ll try to review all definitions.<br><br>

    A graph is a mathematical object with a bunch of things (called “vertices”), some of which have
    connections between them (called “edges”). You could argue that just about anything is a graph. And
    you could extrapolate, perhaps, that graph theory is the most important subject in all of mathematics.
    But all jokes aside: it’s a branch of math in which we get to ask—and sometimes answer—lots
    of interesting questions right away, even without building up too much machinery. For example: in
    Misha’s colloquium from Day 0 about the Icosian Game, we got right to “finding a Hamiltonian cycle
    in a graph.” This week will have a similar flavor to the first half of Misha’s colloquium: we’ll be building
    up some vocabulary as we investigate matchings, planar graphs, colorings, and lots more.

  <p class="info" id="2G9D"><b>Introduction to quantum computing</b> (Jorge, MTWΘF)<br><br>
    In this class, we will introduce what quantum computing is, and we will accomplish two main goals in
    order to do that. First, we introduce the basic unit of quantum information–the qubit. We will study
    the electron spin as a physical example where qubits can be created experimentally, and then we will
    introduce some math in order to represent and manipulate these units of information. (Spoiler: the
    math has a lot to do with vectors and matrices!) <br>
    The second goal is introducing the quantum teleportation algorithm. This is the procedure by
    which we can transport quantum information between two different people, with the only requisites of
    sharing an entangled qubit (I’ll teach you what “entangled” means) and your usual Internet connection
    so you can send over 2 classical bits of information. Why so much trouble just to send information,
    you may ask? Well, as we shall see, measuring quantum information in any way tends to destroy it
    (you can say qubits are very shy), so this algorithm is kind of a big deal for quantum computers to
    work. <br>
    <br><i>Class format:</i> I’ll be using my tablet as a whiteboard, and will lecture as we go. Questions are
    encouraged at any time. Will assign a couple of problems at the end of each lecture.<br>
    <i>Prerequisites:</i> Don’t be intimidated by the description–no quantum mechanics or physics will be
needed! We’ll only need familiarity with how to add and subtract vectors, either numerically (when
given the value of the components) or graphically (if the vectors are drawn on a plane). Knowing how
to operate with matrices is a plus. <br><br>

    How can we tell how hard a problem is? There are a lot of hard problems, but are they just problems
that a human can’t do? Or that might take a computer billions of years to solve? A lot of modern
society depends on the fact that factoring integers is hard; it is how we can do all e-commerce. If this
seems intriguing, we can all sit together and look at SAT or satisfiability and how it relates to all sorts
of other problems!
We will see an overview of some basic complexity class definitions and why it’s interesting to try
to classify problems by their complexity. The class will mainly focus on getting in as many surprising
SAT reductions as we can because why not.

    <b>Lights, camera, group actions!</b> (Emily, <grey>M</grey>TWΘF)<br><br>
    One way of thinking of a group action is that it is a function which “applies” elements of a group to elements of a set to produce a new element of that set. We can have groups act on many different kinds of sets—from sets of numbers to sets of tic-tac-toe boards. They can also act on objects such as polygons or graphs. In fact, you have probably already seen a group action without realizing it: by definition, the dihedral group of size 2<i>n</i> acts on a regular polygon with <i>n</i> sides via rotations and reflections. Groups can even act on themselves, which we will find out to be quite important! <br>
In general, the behavior of a group action give us useful information about the group and the set it acts on. We will explore how various theorems and algorithms hinge upon the theory of group actions, with my personal favorite being how to precisely represent any finite group as a permutation group.  <br><br>

  <p class="info" id="2G13D"><b>Mathcamp crash course</b> (Assaf, MTWΘF)<br><br>
    Math is useless unless it is properly communicated. Most of math communication happens through a
    toolbox of terminology and proof techniques that provide us with a backbone to understand and talk
    about mathematics. These proof techniques are often taken for granted in textbooks, math classes
    (even at Mathcamp!) and lectures. This class is designed to introduce fundamental proof techniques
    and writing skills in order to make the rest of the wonderful world of mathematics more accessible.<br>
    This class will cover direct proofs from axioms, proofs using negation, proofs with complicated
    logical structure, induction proofs, and proofs using cardinality and the pigeonhole principle. If you
    are unfamiliar with these proof techniques, then this class is highly recommended for you. If you have
    heard of these techniques, but would like to practice using them, this class is also right for you.<br>
    Here are some problems that can assess your knowledge of proof writing:<br>
    <br>(1) Negate the following sentence without using any negative words (“no”, “not”, etc.): “If a book
    in my library has a page with fewer than 30 words, then every word on that page starts with a
    vowel.”<br>
    <br>(2) Given two sets of real numbers A and B, we say that A dominates B when for every a ∈ A
    there exists b ∈ B such that a < b. Find two disjoint, nonempty sets A and B such that A
    dominates B and B dominates A.<br>
    <br>(3) Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers.<br>
    <br>(4) Let f : A → B and g : B → C be maps of sets. Prove that if g ◦ f is injective then f is
    injective. (This may be obvious, but do you know how to write down the proof concisely and
    rigorously?)<br>
    <br>(5) Define rigorously what it means for a function to be increasing.<br>
    <br>(6) What is wrong with the following argument (aside from the fact that the claim is false)? On
    a certain island, there are n ≥ 2 cities, some of which are connected by roads. If each city is
    connected by a road to at least one other city, then you can travel from any city to any other
    city along the roads.
    Proof. We proceed by induction on n. The claim is clearly true for n = 1. Now suppose the
    claim is true for an island with n = k cities. To prove that it’s also true for n = k + 1, we
    add another city to this island. This new city is connected by a road to at least one of the old
    cities, from which you can get to any other old city by the inductive hypothesis. Thus you can
    travel from the new city to any other city, as well as between any two of the old cities. This
    proves that the claim holds for n = k + 1, so by induction it holds for all n. <br>
    <br>(7) Mathcampers can message each other privately on Slack over the course of camp. Prove that
    there are two campers who messaged the same number of people throughout camp.
    If you would not be comfortable writing down proofs or presenting your solutions to these problems,
    then you can probably benefit from this crash course. If you found this list of questions intimidating
    or didn’t know how to begin thinking about some of them, then you should definitely take this class.
    It will make the rest of your Mathcamp experience much more enjoyable and productive. And the
    class itself will be fun too!<br>

    What happens to the classical laws of motion as we get closer and closer to the speed of light? A very
young Einstein (in his early 20s) asked this question at the beginning of the 20th century and came to
groundbreaking conclusions, that supported the development of some very interesting mathematics. <br>
In this class, we will cover the mathematical description of space-time (i.e you’ll get to learn why
time is called the “fourth dimension” and how it is NOT really independent from space!) We will study
the correct transformation laws of space-time between two observers in relative motion at speeds in the
order of the speed of light–also known as Lorentz transformations. From these, seemingly-paradoxical
consequences arise: the simultaneity of events, the length of objects and the very perception of time
are seen as different between observers moving at different speeds! <br>
We will also study the algebraic structure of four-vectors, which are needed to describe physical
quantities in a way consistent with Lorentz transformations, as well as the index notation used to
describe tensors. This will be great preparation to continue studying the theory of General Relativity
(see class “The Schwarzchild solution”) on Week 3!

    <b>Myth of the 13 Archimedean Solids</b> (Lizka, <grey>M</grey>TW<grey>ΘF</grey>)<br><br>
    You know about the Platonic Solids: convex polyhedra whose faces are all the same kind of regular n-gon, like cubes and dodecahedra. You might have even seen a proof that there are exactly five of these. A slightly less well known set of polyhedra are the <i> Archimedean Solids </i>. In 1619, Kepler showed that there were exactly 13 Archimedean Solids. In 1997, Peter Cromwell included a full proof of this fact in his book, Polyhedra.<br>
So people were surprised when Branko Grünbaum showed that there are actually 14 Archimedean Solids. (Moral 1. Beware the pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron.)<br>
In this class, we will explore the Archimedean Solids and other cool sets of polyhedra to see how two lines of reasoning led to an identity crisis for the Archimedeans.<br> We will discuss the standard story told about this clash, in the process looking at Leonardo da Vinci’s illustrations, Albrecht Dürer’s experiments, and Kepler’s astronomical theories. Then we will learn why this story is completely made up.<br> The short version of where the story goes astray is that it misses a distinction between discovery and creation in mathematics.

    How many different ways are there to draw a lattice in three dimensions? In order to answer this question, we have to define what a lattice is, and what makes two lattices different from each other. The answer will take us through understanding a variety of symmetries in three dimensions, since we will be classifying these lattices through the ways that they can be left unchanged after various transformations. Many of the materials that surround us turn out to be made of one of these lattice types at a molecular level, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the molecular structure of materials governs many of their physical properties. Lattice structures help explain why diamonds are hard but graphite is soft, why some metals are brittle and others are ductile, and why salt crystals are cubes. We will finish by discussing some of these ways lattices are of interest to materials scientists, engineers, chemists, and crystallographers.  <br><br>

    In real life, interesting quantities usually depend on several variables (such as the coordinates of a
point, the time, the temperature, the number of campers in the room, the real and imaginary parts
of a complex number, ...). Because of this, “ordinary”(single-variable) calculus often isn’t enough to
solve practical problems. In this class, we’ll quickly go through the basics of calculus for functions of
several variables. As time permits, we’ll look at some nice applications, such as: If you’re in the desert
and you want to cool off as quickly as possible, how do you decide what direction to go in? What is
the total area under a bell curve? What force fields are consistent with conservation of energy? <br>
One reason, and maybe the best reason, to take this crash course right now rather than waiting

      A few decades ago, John Conway and some of his colleagues spent several years hard at work playing games. They played classic games like Go, Nim and Dots-and-Boxes, and catalogued new ones like Hackenbush and Sprouts. Eventually a general theory emerged—not the probabilistic game theory of economists, but a deep combinatorial labyrinth of deterministic possibilities. <br>
 Out of all this complexity, we will carve a number system. In order to measure the unfairness of
 partisan games, we’ll construct the surreals, a number system which contains not only the reals and
 the hyperreals, but the ordinals, and every infinite or infinitesimal element of any ordered field set
 theory can build. <br>
 Is this overkill to get a little better at the Go endgame? Of course, but as an algebraic structure,
 it can’t be beat.

   Yikes, but it’s useful (we will see an application!). Even more yikes, we’re going to prove this equality
using partitions, where a partition of a nonnegative integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of
positive integers, e.g. 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 is a partition of 7. Come learn about the shocking and beautiful
interplay between combinatorics and analysis. (The intercast of this interplay includes partitions,
Young diagrams, and generating functions.)

  <p class="info" id="3G2D"><b>Combinatorial species</b> (Linus, MTWΘF )<br><br>
    Permutations are a species. You know how to count how many permutations there are. <br>
Domino tilings of width-2 rectangles, is a species. You may or may not know how to count them. <br>
If you breed them, you get the species “Permutations next to domino tilings.” Or if you breed them
a different way you get “Permutations of domino tilings” or “Domino tilings, where each tile is a
permutation.” Do you know how to count those? How about doing it in literally one line of algebra? <br>

The theory of combinatorial species shows us how to associate each species to a “generating func-
tion,” an algebraic cheat code for solving combinatorics problems. A beautiful correspondence trans-
ports us between algebraic operations on generating functions, and different types of breeding. We’ll

use this to count some elusive types of objects, and also, to give 2-line proofs of a few bijections that
would probably take a whole class period to prove normally.

    <i>Class format:</i> I’ll lecture some amount (more or less depending on the day) and then break y’all into
    breakout rooms. I’ll have some problems for you to solve, as well as time for camper-guided exploration
    and discovery of new species. <br>
    <i>Prerequisites:</i> If you already know how to use generating functions, you’ll be a little bored in day
    1. Knowing how to differentiate functions like xex
    
    is nice, but it’s totally OK to just type it into
    
    WolframAlpha. <br> <br>

    <b>Graph colorings</b> (Mia, MTW</grey>ΘF)<br><br>
    A new island has been discovered in the Arctic Ocean! While the geographers are arguing over how to divide the island, the cartographers begin to wonder about the map: how many colors are needed to color the countries so that any two countries that share a border get different colors? The Four Color Theorem says just four. We won’t prove this – it took over 100 years and a computer program that checked 1,936 different cases to prove this theorem – but we will use this question as a springboard to others.<br>
Suppose the countries decide that they have <i>non-negotiable</i> color preferences. For instance, the country Zudral demands to be cyan or magenta. And the country Scaecia refuses to be anything but light blue, sky blue, or cornflower blue. Given that each country now has a list of allowable colors, how does that change the cartographer’s ability to color the map?<br> Or what if we are allowed countries to be shaded in with several colors? In this case, Zudral could be indecisive and be one half cyan and one half magenta. Or what if we changed up the objective entirely and instead of focusing on the total number of colors used, we tried to minimize the number of colors “seen” in the neighboring countries? <br> Secretly, the questions above can be changed into questions about graph colorings, specifically, list coloring, fractional coloring, and “local coloring” respectively. With each new coloring, there arises a new chromatic number and we return to our central questions: <br> <br>
(1) What are the bounds for this chromatic number? <br>
(2) Can we construct a family of graphs that forces this chromatic number arbitrarily far from its bounds? <br>
Note: Although maps are an excellent motivating example, we will be focusing on general graphs, not just planar graphs!

2 − 4ac. The class number of a given discriminant d
is the number of equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms with discriminant d under a certain
group action. Dirichlet’s proof of his Class Number Formula is a truly beautiful argument, with ideas
ranging from group theory to clever averaging to, at one point, the area of an ellipse. Come explore
one of my favorite proofs of all time!

     <img src="fractal2.png" alt="fractal" class = "fractal"> <img src="jorgensen.png" class = "fractal"> <br><br>
     The fractals above are very symmetric. But the symmetries are not the familiar, Euclidean ones; instead they are of the form <span class="math inline">\(z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is a complex coordinate. Such symmetries are called Möbius transformations. You can generate more fractals like this here: <a href="https://guests.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/gulotta/mc21.html">https://guests.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/gulotta/mc21.html</a>.<br>
     So how do we construct a group of Möbius transformations that produces fractals like these? Surprisingly, the answer involves something called uniformization. Uniformization is the process of expressing a complicated surface as a quotient of a simpler surface by a group action. This allows us to use group theory to understand geometry and topology, and vice versa.<br>
     Our exploration of uniformization will lead to a debate about the proper way to gift-wrap a donut (Fuchs prefers wrapping paper with no holes while Schottky prefers paper with no corners). We will manage to satisfy both sides by taking a bite out of the donut, and we’ll get pretty pictures as a reward.

(2) Every calculus student knows that a + b = b + a. Is it also true that you can rearrange terms
in an infinite series without changing its sum? <br> <br>
Sometimes, things are not as they seem. For example, the answer to the second question is a
resounding “no.” The Riemann rearrangement theorem, which we will see, states that we can rearrange
the terms in infinite series such as:
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">

so that the sum converges to π, e, or whatever we want!

To help us study the questions above and many other ones, the key tool we’ll use is the “epsilon-
delta definition” of a limit. This concept can be hard to work with at first, so we will study many

examples and look at related notions, such as uniform convergence. Being comfortable reasoning with
limits is central to the field of mathematical analysis, and will open the door to some very exciting
mathematics.

    A ring <i>R</i> is called “simple” if its only ideals are {0} and <i>R</i> itself. A commutative ring is simple if and only if it is a field. A good first guess would be that a noncommutative ring is simple if and only if it is a division ring. This would also be a wrong first guess. Unfortunately, in noncommutative rings simplicity gets complicated.<br> In this class we’ll prove the Wedderburn-Artin’s structure theorem for semi simple rings, and see how simplicity and division rings are related. We’ll start this week with a quick jaunt through module theory. We’ll define modules, prove Zassenhaus’s lemma and the Schreier refinement theorem, and use these results to prove the Jordan–Hölder’s theorem, which essentially says that every sufficiently nice module has a unique decomposition into its simplest components.

  <p class="info" id="3G14D"><b>Introduction to ring theory </b> (Susan, MTWΘF ) <br><br>
    Ring theory is a beautiful field of mathematics. We cut ourselves loose from our usual number
systems—the complexes, the reals, the rationals, the integers, and just work with ...stuff. Stuff that
you can add. And multiply. Rings are structures in which addition and multiplication exist and act as they “should.” Polynomials, power series, matrices, real-valued functions on a set—wherever you
have some way of defining an addition and a multiplication, you’ve got a ring.
Somehow, in throwing away the numbers that gave us our initial intuition about how addition and
multiplication should work, we are left with a tool that is immensely powerful. Ring theory is the
backbone of fields such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, homological algebra, and Galois
theory.
This class will be a quick introduction to some of the basics of ring theory. We will cover the ring
axioms, homomorphisms of rings, quotient rings, and several important examples and counterexamples.

sets, and some really fun topological spaces. In this class, we will develop the theory of infinite-type
surfaces and state the classification theorem, which was proven in 1963 by Ian Richards. Along the
way, we will meet some famous infinite-type surfaces with some great names. <br><br>

    180 degrees. <br>
    Certainly rotating through an appropriately sized circle would do the trick, but can we rotate the

    rotate it using arbitrarily small area—that is, through as small a region as we would like! <br>
    This probably surprising and counterintuitive fact (that we’ll prove in class) leads to one of the most
    important and still unsolved conjectures in harmonic analysis: the Kakeya conjecture. In an effort
    to shed some light on this conjecture, mathematicians analyzed the analogous problem in the setting

We will learn the difference between knowing a number (very extremely mind-bogglingly hard) and knowing what a number is worth (surprisingly incredibly magically easy). We will gain the power of being able to figure out the worth of numbers (and many cool corollaries of this power) by making line doodles. In actuality this is a course about the local part of algebraic number theory, but those words won’t show up much until the last day.
